/// uploads a response can include, which is also the default value. You can further limit the number of uploads in a
/// response by specifying the max-uploads parameter in the response. If additional multipart uploads satisfy the list
/// criteria, the response will contain an IsTruncated element with the value true. To list the additional multipart
/// uploads, use the key-marker and upload-id-marker request parameters. In the response, the uploads are sorted by key. If
/// your application has initiated more than one multipart upload using the same object key, then uploads in the response
/// are first sorted by key. Additionally, uploads are sorted in ascending order within each key by the upload initiation
/// time.</summary>
