To use the OnlineTests you will need an access key from your account. See https://github.com/Genbox/SimpleS3/wiki/How-to-create-an-access-key%3F on how to create one.
The tests are using the ProfileManager with encryption to protect your credentials, but before it works, you need to create the profile.

Run the utility 'TestSetup' to create the profile. Also remember to change TestConstants.cs to the correct values of your account
